      <h2>The Lifelong Benefits of Emotionally Mature Parents</h2>
      <p><em>Posted on April 28, 2025</em></p>

      <p> I’ve been seeing more and more content online about how life’s real lottery is your relationship with your parents, and I wholeheartedly agree. The more I learn about the experience of my peers’ upbringings, the more I am both impressed by their strength through adversity and by my absolute blessings that are my own parents. I could honestly talk about this for a long time, as there as seemingly endless reasons why I personally have the best parents on the planet, but instead, I’ll try to keep this to a few main points.  </p>

      <p> First, being raised by parents who value inclusivity, are feminists, believe in climate change, advocate for women’s rights and LGBTQIA+ rights, and instilled those values in me at a young age has been undoubtedly foundational to who I am as a person. Actually having my parents walk the walk of being good people showed me from a young age the importance of sticking up for humans of all walks of life. Several peers of mine had to learn to navigate political topics such as these on their own after leaving behind the place they grew up. That bravery is beautiful, but surely isolating at times. Watching friends question whether to go home during the holidays as they don’t want to discuss politics or negotiate with siblings on how to handle their MAGA parents has been heartbreaking. I’d be terrified as a queer woman if I thought my parents would not support who I wanted to love. That privilege of still being able to look at my parents and believe in the values they taught is not lost on me. </p>

      <p> My parents also provided a lot of support financially throughout the years. I never had to work a job for spending money in high school. And between scholarships, some received through my mom’s work, and the money put away for our college funds, neither my older sibling nor I needed to go into debt to pay for our undergraduate education. We have both bought used cars off of our parents, and they have always been able to help us with a security deposit or minor emergency if need be. Their relative financial literacy has helped me a great deal. And although they no longer do my taxes, and I have taken on that responsibility, they have still been able to guide me towards being smart with my own money. The inherent stress that money can create evaporates when I realize that I will have them to fall back on in a pinch. </p>

      <p> Beyond being a moral compass and a financial support, my parents have let myself grow into my own person. They support my life goals and endeavors, including everything from studying engineering to switching jobs, to moving cities, to starting a PhD program. While there as an ear if needed, they provide sage advice if asked for, and otherwise just feel blessed to have a front row seat to whatever I do next. One particular area of note in my life is the choice to “settle down” and get married and have kids. As an older couple themselves, I thought they were just a bit delayed in poking the bear about getting me to find a suitable partner, but as I am now the age when my mom met my dad, I’m pleasantly surprised with how little they express any desire to be grandparents or to see me walk down an aisle in a white dress. This has allowed me to be significantly more open and honest with them about my future goals as they continue to shift, as I am not scared about any possible judgement or opinions I may face. </p>
    
      <p> Lastly, they truly have become my friends. They don’t nag or annoy me the way I perceived them as a teen, and instead I largely find their presence comforting, as they have intimately known me through out every phase of my life. I find myself wanting to know much more about their experiences growing up and trading stories from college or early jobs that make me see so much of myself in them. So, long and not so eloquently put rant aside, I’m forever grateful for Lisa and Pete, who have truly been my winning lottery ticket for the past three decades. </p>
